# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

A Python tool to evaluate the strength of passwords using entropy and crack time estimation.

## 🚀 Features

- Calculates entropy of passwords
- Estimates time to crack using brute-force (1 billion guesses/sec)
- Detects weak characteristics (length, common passwords, lack of variety)
- Suggests a stronger password

## 🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

## 📦 Usage
